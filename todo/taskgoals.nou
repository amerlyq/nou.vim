    - task couldn't fit the capacity of that day
    - incident occured
    - if checked blocker and must WAIT more for results)
    - "REQ was done" => "WAIT future results"

  "[>]" .vs. "[>5]" markers to estimate overdue/priority
    IDEA: use explicit number (e.g. "[>5]") of times task was consciously replanned/postponned
    BUT: no need to track it explicitly
      BET use git history and estimate time between appearance and closing
      OR: add xtref to each recurrent task when it baked each time
      ALT:(simpler): find last closed entry and compare to recurrent interval
  ALT: annotate each baked event by expired=`2y`=(now-last-period)

  CMP: train.task-execution-planned-time .vs. train.decision-moment-of-postponing
    (1) immediately add xts-train by future planned time
      BAD: unreliable -- almost 100% will change at the day of planning
        i.e. xts-train meaning will be "list of failure attempts to predict task execution time"
      NICE: xts-train reflects "overdue/latency" times which are almost the same as "contract breach"
        BUT: to know the reactive "decision inertion time" we still must save "time-of-replanning-decision" (2)
    (2) ADD xts-train of current decision times
      NICE: reflects chain of times when task held my attention
        BUT: is it useful for anything ?
          ~~ I have fixed "replanning windows" at both morning and evening, so whole train will fit into them
      FAIL: if I retrack to 3-days old forgotten task --
        its 'decision time' won't reflect the period of ignorance/avoidance
    (3) BET: when moving tasks keep mixed history in xts-train
      - save item's old planned time for tasks with time "[_] xx:yy"
      - OR that day's 00:00 if planned time is absent "[@]" / "[!]"
      - NOTE: don't fallback to 'decision time' to avoid (2).FAIL

  CMP: status_of("[>]") == "done" .vs. "todo"
    :: convert status "[_]" -> "[>]" when postponing
    (1) NOW: treat "[>]" as status=done
      - copy([>]) task (with "[_]" status) to future date
      - keep each previous "[>]" copy in all agendas/files its was planned to
        NICE: keep tasks in their original planning ctxs to bind my task-flow together
        FAIL:(useless): after day is "closed" the original ctx is almost always totally lost
        BAD: duplicated but still always somewhat different text in different agendas
    (2) BET? treat "[>]" as status=todo
      - MOVE postponed task to future date
      - keep only single task (in the most recent agenda) -- delete all unaccomplished plans
        NOTE: .git history still keeps intermediate states -- if you MOVE only once per commit
      - BAD: inconsistent "undone" tasks as a mix of
    (3) BET: keep copies only in "significant" contexts (e.g. overtimes)
      - allow keeping copies instead of moving to future
      - keep all "todo" tasks as the same "[_]" (consistency)
      - understand it was postponed by having the xts-trail
