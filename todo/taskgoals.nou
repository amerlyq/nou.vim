    <= because I work with goals [_] => [X] and not actual tasks
  [_] MAYBE: use unicode symbols for checkbox BUT: "wide" are nice but cropped

    BAD: one-symbol checkbox is looking too crumpled

    [_] ALT:BET?TODO: switch hi! places for todo [_] and decision "!!" markers


%% Task/progress
  [_] BUG ru text /[а-я]{1,3}/ treated as /\W+/ => marker placed after it
  THINK if only marker is highlighted and therefore truly visible --> MAYBE:USE: shortened form '_ x' instead of full '[_] [X]'?
  MAYBE: use shorter date spec?
    160716:[X]
    [X=160716]
    [X]/160716
  [_] Highlight: 'X' green, '$' red, '_' blue, '[' ']' white, '<date>' -- italic dark-gray
    ? THINK: how to define region ?
  [_] THINK limit task markers only to beginning of line
    !! Performance
    ? hard to test ?
  2016-09-12 [X] BUG: task symbol "_" affects underlined text
    * Use nesting marginal effects -- create for '[_]' its own syntax group
  [_] TRY: different color for todo:(blueish) / done:(grayish) / cancel:(yellow-orange-brownish)


%%% Priority
  MAYBE override highlighting of whole line?
    BUT how about mixed body coloring of priority/outline/decision?
    THINK don't mix them at all -- all are placed in different sections of notes
      # Each section -- indented block at 1st level
      ? THINK what if to allow nested blocks indented relative to current level?
        = Too complex. Moreover -- what if I need only one decision-like line inside outline?
  THINK how to combine with decision-making markers to order statements
    Maybe simply add number before/after decision markers?
    # USE:(formats)  *1 8* 4% %3 #2 ~2 !3
    Repeating marker -- several highest priorities (accentuation)
    # USE:(like) * ** ***  OR ! !! !!!
    TRY: inherit decision color (simply by adding '\d=' in its pattern) or contain its own
  [_] USE: #tag beside priority !2 to mark and filter "todo" lines based on topic
    ~ !1 #tag #tag [_]
    ~ !2#tag#tag [_]
    ~ !3 [_] #tag #tag
    ~ !4 [_]#tag#tag
