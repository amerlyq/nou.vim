  [_] MAYBE:CHG: "2020-01-14 [10%] ..." => "2020-01-14 10% ..." OR "2020-01-14 %10 ..."
    <= because I work with goals [_] => [X] and not actual tasks
  [_] MAYBE: use unicode symbols for checkbox BUT: "wide" are nice but cropped
    VIZ: ☐❏ | 🗹 ☑✓✔✅🗸 | ⮽☒✗✘𐄂❌🗴🗶🗵 🗷
    BAD: one-symbol checkbox is looking too crumpled

    [_] ALT:BET?TODO: switch hi! places for todo [_] and decision "!!" markers


%% Task/progress
  [_] ALT:USE: super-task to update number and track progress after each subtask
    NOW
      * copying the same task with different [30%].. [50%].. [80%] is wrong -- no way to "continue"
      * tracking progress in #tag to continue [_] #30% is wrong too -- incomplete task is non-contiguous gibberish [80%] #30% ...
      * each "task" has only two genuine states: [_] and [X] with their respective two timestamps / xtrefs
    IDEA= project-progress .vs. task-completion
      * you track subtasks in .cal view -- only binary states for each one
      * you track project progress in .proj view -- update "finish" progress after each subtask is done or new subtask created
      [_] NEED: bind subtasks xtrefs to main task
      [_] NEED: sum estimated times per each task to evaluate precise progress value
    [_] MAYBE: make colors for 80-95% more bright to stimulate completion
      => the must "shout" !finish me now, there is almost nothing left!
      NOW:BAD: dark colors are easily overlooked when searching incomplete tasks to be done
  [_] BUG ru text /[а-я]{1,3}/ treated as /\W+/ => marker placed after it
  THINK if only marker is highlighted and therefore truly visible --> MAYBE:USE: shortened form '_ x' instead of full '[_] [X]'?
  MAYBE: use shorter date spec?
    160716:[X]
    [X=160716]
    [X]/160716
  [_] Highlight: 'X' green, '$' red, '_' blue, '[' ']' white, '<date>' -- italic dark-gray
    ? THINK: how to define region ?
  [_] THINK limit task markers only to beginning of line
    !! Performance
    ? hard to test ?
  2016-09-12 [X] BUG: task symbol "_" affects underlined text
    * Use nesting marginal effects -- create for '[_]' its own syntax group
  [_] TRY: different color for todo:(blueish) / done:(grayish) / cancel:(yellow-orange-brownish)


%%% Priority
  MAYBE override highlighting of whole line?
    BUT how about mixed body coloring of priority/outline/decision?
    THINK don't mix them at all -- all are placed in different sections of notes
      # Each section -- indented block at 1st level
      ? THINK what if to allow nested blocks indented relative to current level?
        = Too complex. Moreover -- what if I need only one decision-like line inside outline?
  THINK how to combine with decision-making markers to order statements
    Maybe simply add number before/after decision markers?
    # USE:(formats)  *1 8* 4% %3 #2 ~2 !3
    Repeating marker -- several highest priorities (accentuation)
    # USE:(like) * ** ***  OR ! !! !!!
    TRY: inherit decision color (simply by adding '\d=' in its pattern) or contain its own
  [_] USE: #tag beside priority !2 to mark and filter "todo" lines based on topic
    ~ !1 #tag #tag [_]
    ~ !2#tag#tag [_]
    ~ !3 [_] #tag #tag
    ~ !4 [_]#tag#tag
