ex: demarkate my #work and #home activities as strong/weak

TODO
  [_] BAD: icon column unaligned due to varying <estimate> length

  [⡡⡰⠩⣃] MAYBE: use "mood" icon for each kind of #hours ::: NOT
    FAIL: #hours attribute time-slots, not tasks
    i.e. #hours:strong is a timeslot for all tasks, which make you weak

  [⡡⡰⠡⣸] 30m FIND: new markup symbols
    {R|S} %R | ☀☼⁕♪⌃⬆⬑⬏⮝⌁🔌    # Replenishing/Refill -> Strong

  [⡡⡰⠦⡔] 20m DECI replace infix=planned ::: USE: +mood=(⌁ ⎓ ⏻)
    BET? append additional status
      [X] ⋆☼ 15m planned + strong
      [X] ⋆⌯ 15m planned + neutral
      [X] ⋆☁ 15m planned + weak
      [X] ↯⌁ 15m sudden + strong
      [X] ↯⎓ 15m sudden + neutral
      [X] ↯⏻ 15m sudden + weak
    ALT: traling suffix -- less intrusive (to keep energy out of focus)
      [X] ↯ 15m some completed task something {D}
    OR: inline prefix -- more standout (to sort activities at glance)
      [X] ⋆ 15m {W} some completed task something
    NICE:MAYBE: use them as a "mood" after "infix+estimate"
      [X] ⋆ 15m ⌁ sudden + strong
      [X] ↯ 15m ⏻ sudden + weak
      [⡡⡰⠩⠩] ? how to be with ordering relative to <assoc> ?
        ::: TEMP: place after assoc, like any other "mood"
        FUTURE: if it will conflict with too much mood icons --> move <energy> before <assoc>
